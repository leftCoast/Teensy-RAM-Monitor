Teensy 3.x RAM Monitor
======================

Dynamic Memory Monitor for Teensy 3.x by Adrian Hunt

> Supports Teensy 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, and Teensy LC

This repository is a fork of [the original code](https://sourceforge.net/p/teensy-3-x-rammonitor), 
which is hosted on source forge. I have additionally recreated the 
[original Wiki information](extras/HOME.md), as well as relicensed the code 
under the MIT license, and added support for Teensy 3.5, 3.6, and Teensy LC.


Overview
--------

Simplifies Teensy 3.x memory monitoring; providing both "raw" memory 
information and with frequent calls to the run() function, adjusted information 
with simulated stack allocations. Memory is also monitored for low memory state 
and stack and heap crashes.


Installation
------------

Download a zip of the repository, then include it from the Arduino IDE.


Usage
-----

See [examples/simple/RamMonitorExample.ino] for an example sketch.
